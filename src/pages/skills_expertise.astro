				<h2 id="eval_research"> EVALUATION &amp; RESEARCH</h2>

				<p>
					CHSR staff are skilled at designing evaluations and research studies using both qualitative and
					quantitative methods,
					and at conducting evaluation studies using primary and secondary data with a variety of research
					techniques. Frequent
					methods of data collection include phone, mail, and online surveys (programmed by our two
					Qualtrics-certified research
					experts); key informant interviews and focus groups; participant observation; use of administrative
					datasets; and use of
					existing programmatic data, including document reviews and data extraction. CHSR also has extensive
					expertise in
					quantitative and qualitative data analysis of large and small data sets using exploratory and advanced
					analysis
					techniques, including multivariate regressions, propensity score matching, network analyses, coding, and
					thematic
					analyses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, CHSR staff are skilled at providing useful feedback to key stakeholders and service providers,
					program
					administrators, policymakers, and the general public. CHSR produces comprehensive and topic-focused
					reports and research
					briefs, peer-reviewed publications, formal and informal presentations, and engaging and meaningful data
					visualizations
					that help to share project results and recommendations with all appropriate audiences
